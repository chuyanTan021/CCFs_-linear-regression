# CCFs_-linear-regression
Build a rergression model for some Cloud metrics(like LWP or sth ..) to picked CCF(Cloud Controlling Factors) in GCMs .


# Nov 27 updated
Cloud metric choosed: Liquid Water Path(clwvi-clivi);  CCF choosed: SST(1,ts, or skin Temperature), p-e(2,pr - evspsbl, need to to prove hem are nearly close to MOISTUREconv),
Subsidence(4,wap at 500hPa) , and LTS(3,Lower Tropospheric Stability, Theta700(850?) - Thetasfc, ps/ts/ta at 700mb needed).
Using some modules to help analyziing the GCM data automatically, need to improved.
